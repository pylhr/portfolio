# The Art of the Side Hustle

To deepen my understanding of programming languages and their inner workings, I started studying Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom. This book is a great starting point for someone interested in learning interpreter design.

In this post , I will share my insights and learnings from the chapter titled 'A Map of the territory'. This chapter sets the stage for the entire book, providing a high level overview of the concepts and structures to be encountered further.

## Key concepts covered

- The Structure Of Language Implementation: There are two typical components of a language implementation, including front end(which handles syntax and parsing) and the backend(which deals with execution).There is a middle end too which is basically an Intermediate Representation. This section provides a roadmap of the various stages involved in processing and running a program.

- Syntax and Semantics: The chapter introduces the concepts of the structure of syntax(the structure of code) and semantics(the meaning behind it).These are the foundational ideas critical for understanding how interpreters parse and execute programs.

- Abstract Syntax Trees: A key data structure used for interpreter design is AST, it represents the hierarchical structure of source code. ASTs are used to bridge the gap between the raw source code and executable instructions.

- Interpreters vs. Compilers: This chapter affirms the difference between compilers and interpreters using following example.

I am quoting it from the book - "What’s the difference between a compiler and an interpreter ?It turns out this is like asking the difference between a fruit and a vegetable. That seems like a binary either-or choice, but actually “fruit” is a botanical term and “vegetable” is culinary. One does not strictly imply the negation of the other. There are fruits that aren’t vegetables (apples) and vegetables that aren’t fruits (carrots), but also edible plants that are both fruits and vegetables, like tomatoes."

- Compiling is an implementation technique that involves translating a source code from source language to other language - not necessarily but usually low level form. Compilation do not execute the code but just transforms it.

- Meanwhile interpreter is an implementation which takes the source code and executes it immediately, i.e. running the program from source code.

## Applications and Practical Insights

The knowledge gained from this chapter has numerous practical applications. For instance, understanding the difference between interpreters and compilers can inform decisions about which tool to use for specific programming tasks. Additionally, the concept of ASTs is widely applicable in areas such as code analysis, optimization, and transformation.

In a real-world scenario, these foundational concepts are crucial for building tools like linters, compilers, and code editors. By understanding the underlying structures and processes, developers can create more efficient and effective software tools.

## Conclusion

The "Map of the Territory" chapter in "Crafting Interpreters" is a vital starting point for anyone interested in the field of language implementation. It provides a comprehensive overview of the key concepts and structures, setting the stage for deeper exploration. By grasping these foundational ideas, readers can build a solid base for understanding and creating interpreters.
